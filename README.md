Starfield Ship Planner

Updating the Parts
------------------
The `starfield.json` file is generated by `partlist.py`. This script gets data from two files: `partlist.csv` and `more_items.json`.

`partlist.csv` is exported from [Nebur Wolf's Ship Designer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1waXdwRiQ5LrqqvtI0kRgL0reL_HdGHGR5ry4ytmDIWM/edit).
To update it, make a copy of the spreadsheet, then un-hide the "Parts List" tab. Make any necessary changes and download this tab as `partlist.csv`.
(The version of `partlist.csv` in this repository has a few minor corrections applied to it already.)

`more_items.json` is loaded after the CSV. It is structured in the same way as `starfield.json` and contains parts that aren't included in the Ship
Designer spreadsheet, specifically the ComSpike, Conduction Grid, and all of the Structural components. This file was originally created by scraping
the  before filling in missing data and correcting errors using further research.

Thanks to the [Inara Starfield Database](https://inara.cz/starfield/) for providing the first user-friendly database of ship parts I could find.

Future development will draw upon [gfntyjzpirqf's Starfield Ship Parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/17bkze8/comprehensive_ship_parts/)
for geometry and attachment point information.
